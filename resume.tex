\begin{mysection}{Experience}
Randox Laboratories \hfill Jan 2024 – Apr 2024 \\
Embedded Software Intern \hfill Antrim, Northern Ireland
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,left=0pt,label={--}]
	\item 
	Mastered legacy C++ codebase for Evidence Evolution—medical robot,
	enabling critial bug fixes that increased uptime by 30\%, 
	by patching root causes of failures indentified through sparse logs
	\item
	Reduced service time, 
	decreased machine update duration from 1 hour to 10 minutes and prevented bricking, 
	by reverse engineering updates to identify and add missing wait condition to scripts
	\item
	Improved software engineering team accountability, 
	shown through successful version tracking and rollback consistency,
	by implementing and educating on structured Git versioning procedure
