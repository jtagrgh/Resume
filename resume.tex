Randox Laboratories \hfill Jan 2024 - Apr 2024 \\
Embedded Software Intern \hfill Antrim, Northern Ireland
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,left=0pt]
	\item Helped make the Evidence Evolution reliable—very old, Linux, C++, parallel scheduling, clinical analysis robot
	\item Gained a deep understanding of the 500K+ lines-of-code machine software in the absence of senior developers
	\item Quickly linked chemical analysis to C++ code to explain results for chemists and biomedical engineers
	\item Repurposed sensors and augmented task scheduling code to gracefully handle an irregular hardware fault
	\item Uncovered and patched a fatal bug in a Linux cron job that nobody found for years; increased uptime by 10%
	\item Collaborated with operators to remove pain points in Qt GUI; modified data categorization; improved user efficiency
	\item Streamlined release management by integrating and educating on git-flow procedure best practices
	\item Transferred my key findings about fixing legacy software to the developers of an up-coming product line
\end{itemize}

Arup \hfill Jan 2023 – Apr 2023 \\
Software Intern \hfill Toronto, Ontario, Canada
\begin{itemize}
	\item Developed new features for MassMotion—C++, desktop application for 3D pedestrian simulation
	\item Routinely showed alternative ways to write more expressive code with modern C++20 features
	\item Built an indent reformat feature for the internal Python script editor to reduce code sharing friction for users
	\item Added live syntax error feedback to the script editor using Tree-sitter to reduce the edit-compile-test loop
	\item Improved maintainability of the script editor search by isolating and unit testing its main data structure (circular buffer)
	\item Demonstrated strong communication skills with well-received end-of-term presentation
\end{itemize}

Evertz \hfill May 2022 – Aug 2022 \\
Embedded Systems Intern \hfill Burlington, Ontario, Canada
\begin{itemize}
	\item Validated and improved the MIO-BLADE-Z21—Embedded, Linux, C++, Audio/Video Processing Device
	\item Prototyped library with C++ templating and subject-observer pattern to simplify inter-process callbacks
	\item Researched and reported on latest IEEE video payload specs; confirmed compliance
\end{itemize}

Genellipse \hfill Sept 2021 – Dec 2021 \\
Software Intern \hfill Mississauga, Ontario, Canada
\begin{itemize}
	\item Co-architected a live data dashboard; leveraged Python, and AWS Lambda for cost efficiency; eliminated reporting time
	\item Integrated GitLab CI/CD pipeline into the dashboard development; allowed consistent error-free deployment
\end{itemize}

Demand Power \hfill Jan 2021 – Apr 2021 \\
Data Analysis Intern \hfill Toronto, Ontario, Canada
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented genetic algorithm in Python for battery use optimization; provided revenue stream insight
\item Analyzed client energy data using Python Pandas and presented findings to COO; revealed carbon reduction potential
\end{itemize}
